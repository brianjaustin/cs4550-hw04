Please fill in answers to the questions below:


1. What's your name?
Brian Austin

2. What hostname did you deploy your app to?
hw04.baustin-neu.site

3. What's the URL of your git for this assignment?
https://github.com/brianjaustin/cs4550-hw04

4. How much of the functionality did you complete?
All. I verified by running the tests (including new ones
for palindrome) and trying a few examples on the running application.

5. Did you successfully deploy? If not, what's broken?
Yes.

6. How comfortable do you feel with Elixir now?
I feel fairly comfortable with the language and navigating its docs.
Interpreting compiler error messages still needs some work (it took me
almost 10 minutes to figure out that "unexpected reserved word 'end'" actually
meant I forgot to put `do` after my module name).

7. Which parts of this assignment did you have trouble with, if any?
I had some trouble thinking about the process for handling calculations
in Reverse Polish Notation. In the end, the article I linked in that file
helped a lot to visualize what goes on.
